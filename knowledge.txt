[SKILLS]
Ezz’s core skills include:
- Statistical data analysis using Python, R, and Excel. Experienced in regression, forecasting, and modeling.
- Machine learning techniques including supervised and unsupervised learning with scikit-learn, XGBoost, and SHAP for explainability.
- Time series forecasting and econometric modeling.
- Web development with Django, Flask, Streamlit, and Supabase for building interactive dashboards and full-stack solutions.
- Automation using Python scripting and custom tool-building to streamline workflows and data pipelines.
- Leadership and teamwork: co-founding research centers, coordinating teams, and leading scholarship initiatives.

[PROJECTS]
XANE Chatbot
A custom-built AI assistant integrated into Ezz’s portfolio website. 
The chatbot answers questions about Ezz’s background, skills, projects, and research. 
It uses OpenRouter as the main LLM API and Pollinations as a fallback to ensure reliability. 
Key features include:
  - Draggable floating chat bubble for an interactive UI.
  - Ability to read from a knowledge base to respond with accurate, context-aware answers.
  - Support for handling text, PDFs, and image uploads.
  - Image generation powered by Flux and Turbo models.
  - Supabase backend for file and chat storage.
Purpose: To create a more engaging portfolio that visitors can explore conversationally.

Statistical Modeling Toolkit
A Streamlit-based toolkit designed to automate statistical modeling tasks. 
It includes three main modules:
  1. Linear Regression (with diagnostics like multicollinearity checks and residual plots).
  2. Logistic Regression (with confusion matrices, ROC curves, and variable importance charts).
  3. Time Series Analysis (stationarity tests, forecasting models, and confidence intervals).
Highlights:
  - Automatically runs diagnostics such as normality tests and multicollinearity detection.
  - Generates interactive visualizations with Plotly.
  - Provides detailed plain-language explanations of statistical results, making them accessible to non-experts.
Tech Stack: Python, Statsmodels, scikit-learn, and Plotly.

Spanish Dairy Farms Panel Data Research
This academic research analyzed data from 247 Spanish dairy farms with 1,482 observations over time. 
Using panel data econometric models, Ezz identified that milk output was strongly influenced by two key factors:
  - Number of cows: 0.66% impact.
  - Feed cost: 0.38% impact.
The purpose of this research was to evaluate resource efficiency and productivity factors within the dairy farming industry.

VIX Time Series Forecasting
This project involved modeling the Volatility Index (VIX), a measure of stock market volatility. 
Ezz used autoregressive models (AR(I)) combined with cubic terms to forecast future volatility values.
Performance:
  - Achieved 6.67% MAPE (mean absolute percentage error).
  - Forecasted VIX values ranging from 19.3 to 28.65 extending to the year 2034.
Purpose: To understand market volatility trends and produce accurate predictive insights.

Blood Pressure Modeling
A statistical research project focused on understanding factors that influence blood pressure. 
The analysis revealed three major predictors:
  - Age
  - Body Surface Area (BSA)
  - Pulse
The final regression model achieved an adjusted R² of 90.1%.
Purpose: To improve insights into cardiovascular health through statistical modeling.

[MSTAG]
MSTAG is a collaborative platform co-founded by Ezz to promote interdisciplinary projects. 
Its guiding philosophy is "Passion over polish," encouraging experimentation and creative research without the pressure of perfection.
